# Trees C# implementation (Currently just BST)
I did this just for fun.

##TODO:
* Downgrade solution from vs2013 to vs2012.
* BST: Alternate version that uses keys instead of values to sort through
* BST: Write some documentation
* Switch unittest from VS' test suite to NUnit.
* Try heap trees.

This project uses the Unlicense.
